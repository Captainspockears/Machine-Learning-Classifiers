# Machine-Learning-Classifiers
I built a gender classifier using 4 classifiers in the sklearn library.

The classifiers are:
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
3. Support Vector Machines Classifier
4. K Neighbours Classifier

I compared the accuracy of the various classifers.

I learnt this from the following sources:
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU - the code
2. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/ - deciding which classifiers I can use

Problems I faced:
1. I don't know when do use each classifier
2. I dont understand the math behind the classifiers
3. I'm not sure that my method of finding the accuracy is right. By repeating the execution a million times, Im testing the precision, not the accuracy. If someone could find a way to test the accuracy, that would be great
